This is a python port of a ruby port of arc90's readability project

http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/

In few words,
Given a html document, it pulls out the main body text and cleans it up.
It also can clean up title based on latest readability.js code.

Based on:
 - Latest readability.js ( https://github.com/MHordecki/readability-redux/blob/master/readability/readability.js )
 - Ruby port by starrhorne and iterationlabs
 - Python port by gfxmonk ( https://github.com/gfxmonk/python-readability , based on BeautifulSoup )
 - Decruft effort to move to lxml ( http://www.minvolai.com/blog/decruft-arc90s-readability-in-python/ )
 - "BR to P" fix from readability.js which improves quality for smaller texts.
 - Github users contributions.
